#+TITLE: Hi! I'm Nazar

I'm a human being that deeply enjoys the art of computer
programming. I'm very curious and interested in various programming
languages and technologies ranging from web development to systems
programming and network engineering.

I'm deeply fan of emacs and lisp language, as my daily routine i'm using emacs in all aspects, even
this article is written and deployed to this website using emacs.
